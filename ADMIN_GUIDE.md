## 1. Setting Up Obsidian Templates

Obsidian has a built-in feature called **Templates**. Templates allow you to insert pre-written "Frontmatter" (the configuration settings at the top of a file) into any new note with just a click.

### How to Enable Templates in Obsidian:
1. Open your MindOnChain folder in Obsidian.
2. Click the **Gear icon (Settings)** in the bottom left corner.
3. Go to **Core Plugins** and make sure **Templates** is toggled ON.
4. Create a folder in your Obsidian vault called `Obsidian_Templates` (or just `Templates`).
5. Go back to Settings > **Templates**, and set the **Template folder location** to that folder.

### The Core Templates to Create
In your templates folder, create these markdown files and copy-paste the text below into them:

#### Template 1: `TPL - Standard Blog Post`
Use this when you are writing a standard article for your blog.
```markdown
---
title: "{{title}}"
date: {{date}}
lastmod: {{date}}
draft: false
cover: "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=YOUR_FILE_ID"
categories: ["Tech"] # Use exactly one category (e.g., Tech, Life, Books)
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
featured: false # Set to true to pin it as an "Editor's Pick" on the homepage
---

**Write an engaging summary or intro paragraph here...**

<!--more-->

The rest of your post content goes here. The `<!--more-->` tag ensures the excerpt on the homepage looks clean.
```

#### Template 2: `TPL - Gated Guide / Private Post`
Use this to create password-protected guides or VIP blog posts.
```markdown
---
title: "{{title}}"
date: {{date}}
draft: true
private: true
password_id: "default"
cover: "https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=YOUR_FILE_ID"
categories: ["Guides"]
tags: []

#### Template 3: `TPL - ECU Database`
Use this when manually adding a new ECU pinout, OBD procedure, or immobilizer guide.
```markdown

title: "{{title}}"

tags: ["bench", "eeprom"]
categories: ["Database", "Immobilizer"]
brand: "Brand Name"

## 2. Creating a Post Using Obsidian

When you need to make a new post manually, follow these simple steps:

1. In Obsidian, navigate to the correct folder where the post should live:
   - **Blog Posts & Guides:** `content/posts/`
   - **ECU Database:** `content/alltech/database/BrandName/ModelName/`
   - **Concierge:** `content/alltech/concierge/`
2. Create a new Note (`Ctrl+N` or `Cmd+N`) inside that folder.
3. Give the note a clear title (e.g., `toyota-camry-2gr-fe.md`).
4. Press `Ctrl+P` (or `Cmd+P`) to open the Command Palette, type **"Insert Template"**, and press Enter.
5. Select the appropriate Template (Blog, Private Guide, Database, or Concierge).
6. Fill in the specific details and hit save!

## 3. How to Set and Change Passwords

The passwords for gated content are managed centrally in your `hugo.toml` configuration file. The actual password text is **never** stored; instead, a secure SHA-256 hash of the password is saved.

### To change the password
1. Open `hugo.toml` in your editor.
2. Scroll down to the `[params.passwords]` section. You will see:
   ```toml
   [params.passwords]
   default = "8d969eef6ecad3c29a3a629280e686cf0c3f5d5a86aff3ca12020c923adc6c92" # Example hash
   ```
3. Generate a new SHA-256 hash for your new password in your terminal:
   ```bash
   echo -n "MyNewPassword123" | sha256sum
   ```
   *(Alternatively, use any free online SHA-256 hash generator).*
4. Replace the old hash string in `hugo.toml` with the new hash.

### To create multiple different passwords
If you want different guides to have different passwords, you can add more keys to `hugo.toml`:
```toml
[params.passwords]
default = "<hash1>"
vip_access = "<hash2>"
```
Then, in the front matter of your post, specify which password to use: `password_id: "vip_access"`.

## 4. Linking Images and PDFs from Google Drive

To keep the website incredibly fast and save storage, **all images and PDFs should be hosted on your Google Drive**.

### Step 1: Organize Your Google Drive
When you share the folder with the nested car brands, organize it clearly:
- `Locksmith_Database/`
  - `Toyota/`
    - `Camry_2016_Pinout.jpg`
    - `Corolla_EEPROM_Guide.pdf`

### Step 2: Get the Google Drive Link
1. Right-click the image or PDF in Google Drive and select **Share**.
2. Under "General Access", change it from "Restricted" to **"Anyone with the link"**.
3. Click **"Copy Link"**. 
   - The link will look like this: `https://drive.google.com/file/d/1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i/view?usp=sharing`

### Step 3: Convert the Link for Your Website
Hugo needs a direct download link to display the image. You must take the **FILE ID** from the link above (e.g., `1a2b3c4d5e6f7g8h9i`) and format it like this:

**`https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=YOUR_FILE_ID`**

### Step 4: Add it to Your Obsidian Post
- **For an Image inside the text:** `![Image Description](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=YOUR_FILE_ID)`
- **For a PDF Download Link:** `[Click Here to Download PDF Manual](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=YOUR_FILE_ID)`
- **For a Cover Image (in the Frontmatter):** Just paste the converted link inside the quotes for `images:` or `cover:`.

## 5. Design & Operation Guidelines (Recent Features)

To maintain the sophisticated, mature design identity of MindOnChain, adhere to the following rules when creating content:

### 1. The Zero-Emoji Policy
Emojis are strictly banned from all content, titles, and layout elements to ensure maximum professionalism. 
- Do not use emojis in your Obsidian templates or markdown files (removed from the templates above).
- If you need to indicate a status, use text brackets. For example, use `[Private]` or `[Locked]` instead of 🔒, and `[Buyer Only]` instead of 🛒.

### 2. Compact List Views
The site uses highly efficient, compact list designs (grouping by year and date) to maximize information density. 
- You do not need to worry about styling post cards; just ensure your `title`, `date`, and `tags` are correct in the frontmatter, and Hugo will automatically render them elegantly without taking up too much screen space.

### 3. Theme Variables
If you ever need to write custom HTML/CSS inside a post, always use the site's theme variables for colors to ensure perfect contrast in both Light and Dark modes.
- Primary Accent: `var(--color-accent-primary)`
- Text color: `var(--color-text-primary)`
- Background: `var(--color-bg-primary)`
- Borders: `var(--color-border)`

---

## Summary of Maintenance
1. You use **Obsidian Templates** to instantly load the correct formatting for any new feature or section.
2. You save your files directly into the respective `content/` folders.
3. You use **Google Drive IDs** to display all visual media.
4. You adhere to the **Zero-Emoji Policy** and let the automated Hugo layouts handle the mature styling.
