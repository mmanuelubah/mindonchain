### Safety Notes

> **Warning:** This system does not require the immobilizer module device to be rewritten.
>
> **Warning:** The transponder will lock and begin rolling sync with vehicle memory the first time it is turned in the ignition.
>
> **Warning:** Save the extracted BIN file; it can be reused in the future to produce additional transponders without reading the module again.
