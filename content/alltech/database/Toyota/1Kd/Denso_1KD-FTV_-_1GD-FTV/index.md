## Programming Instructions

**Method:** `BENCH`

### Bench / Wiring Steps

> **Required Tool:** Bench Flash Tool / ECU Power Supply

1. For 1KD-FTV (06.2015 - 08.2020):
2. Connect Ground (GND) to pin C36-12 (E1).
3. Connect Constant Power (+12V BATT) to pin G55-24 (BATT).
4. Connect Switched Power (+12V IGN) to pins G55-23 (+B), G55-22 (+B2), and G55-21 (IGSW).
5. Connect CAN High to pin G56-31 (CANH) and CAN Low to pin G56-25 (CANL).
6. For 1GD-FTV (06.2015 - NOW):
7. Connect Ground (GND) to pin C93-1 (E1).
8. Connect Constant Power (+12V BATT) to pin G57-23 (BATT).
9. Connect Switched Power (+12V IGN) to pins G57-24 (+B), G57-17 (+B2), and G58-24 (IGSW).
10. Connect CAN High to pin G58-35 (CANH) and CAN Low to pin G58-36 (CANL).
