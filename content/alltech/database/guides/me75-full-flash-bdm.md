## Overview

BDM (Background Debug Mode) is the lowest-level access method for Motorola/Freescale MPC5xx processors used in Bosch ME7.x ECUs. This guide covers the full flash read, modify, and write procedure using a BDM100 or compatible adapter.

## Required Tools

- BDM100 adapter (or KESS/KTAG with BDM support)
- Soldering iron (fine tip, 350°C)
- 26-gauge Kynar wire
- ECU bench harness or 134-pin breakout
- WinOLS or TunerPro for calibration editing
- Known-good ME7.5 binary (backup)

## BDM Pinout

| Pin | Signal | Wire Color |
|-----|--------|------------|
| 1  | GND  | Black   |
| 2  | DSCK  | Yellow   |
| 3  | DSDI  | Green   |
| 4  | DSDO  | Blue    |
| 5  | RESET | Red    |
| 6  | VCC  | Orange   |

## Procedure

### 1. Open the ECU

Remove the 4 Torx T20 screws from the aluminum housing. Carefully separate the PCB from the casing. The BDM header pads are located near the MPC555 processor.

### 2. Solder BDM Wires

Solder Kynar wires to the BDM pads. Use flux and tin each pad before attaching. Keep wires under 10cm to minimize signal degradation.

### 3. Connect to BDM100

Wire the pads to the BDM100 adapter following the pinout above. Connect USB to your PC. Launch the BDM100 software.

### 4. Full Read

Select **MPC555 > Read Full Flash**. This will extract the entire 2MB flash contents including calibration, program code, and EEPROM shadow. Save as `.bin`.

### 5. Modify Calibration

Open the binary in WinOLS. Apply your calibration changes (fueling maps, ignition timing, rev limiter, etc.). Verify the checksum correction module is applied.

### 6. Write Back

Select **MPC555 > Write Full Flash**. Upload your modified binary. The write process takes approximately 3-4 minutes. Do not disconnect power during this operation.

### 7. Verify

Perform a **Read** again after writing and compare checksums. They must match exactly. Reassemble the ECU and install in the vehicle.

> **Critical**: A failed BDM write can brick the ECU. Always maintain a known-good backup binary. If the write fails mid-process, do NOT power cycle — attempt the write again immediately.
